# # ZIP to Hash Converter

## Description

This Python script converts a ZIP file into a hash format suitable for password-cracking tools like John the Ripper, mimicking the behavior of `zip2john`. It extracts metadata from the ZIP file and generates a hash-like string that includes the file's CRC32 checksum, compressed and uncompressed sizes, and a hexadecimal representation of the file's contents.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

No installation is required. Simply save the provided Python script to a file (e.g., `zip_to_hash.py`).

### Running the Script

1.  **Save the script:** Save the Python code to a file named `zip_to_hash.py`.

2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

3.  **Run the script:**

    ```
    python zip_to_hash.py
    ```

    You may need to specify the ZIP file path directly in the script or provide it as a command-line argument (see "Customizing the Script" below).

### Customizing the Script

#### 1. Specifying the ZIP File

By default, the script uses a placeholder path (`/path/to/your/file.zip`). You need to modify the script to point to your actual ZIP file. Open `zip_to_hash.py` in a text editor and change the `zip_file` variable:
